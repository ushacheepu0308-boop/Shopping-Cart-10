Problem Statement
------------------
In modern e-commerce platforms, shopping carts are essential to allow customers to collect items before purchase.

This project will build a Shopping Cart system where:
a. Items can be added to or removed from a cart.
b. The cart should behave like a list using operator overloading (__add__, __len__, __getitem__, etc.).
c. Students will practice implementing Python dunder methods to give objects natural behaviors.
d. Reports such as cart contents and total price should be generated.

students will learn:
-------------------- 
Classes & Objects
Operator Overloading / Dunder Methods
	__str__ for printing
	__add__ to add items/carts
	__len__ to count items
	__getitem__ for indexing
	__contains__ for checking membership
Lists & Dictionaries (to store items)
Encapsulation (Cart manages its own items)
Reports & Summaries


Step-by-Step Workflow for Students:
-----------------------------------
1. Create Item class → holds product details (name, price, quantity).
2. Create ShoppingCart class → holds a list of items.
3. Overload operators in ShoppingCart:
	__str__: show cart contents.
	__len__: return number of items.
	__getitem__: access item by index.
	__contains__: check if an item exists.
	__add__: allow adding an item or combining carts.

4. Implement methods:
	add_item()
	remove_item()
	total_price()
5. Create a menu in main.py to test operations interactively.

Student Breakdown of Tasks
---------------------------
Student A: Implement Item class and its __str__ method.
Student B: Implement ShoppingCart class basics (add_item, remove_item, storage).
Student C: Implement operator overloading (__add__, __len__, etc.) and reporting (total_price)
